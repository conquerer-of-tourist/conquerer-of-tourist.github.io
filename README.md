**ReadMe for Hengsheng's Blog / Website**

Hello there, I will post my solutions and other stuff here

**About Me**

My name is Hengsheng, and I do a lot of programming and math. I swim, too. I have a lot of other interests, and I will list them here: robotics, drawing, cubing, etc. I can't think of any more. I'll think more later.

One of my favorite quotes from a friend: "I was thinking about math until I walked into a wall."

**School**

I won't tell you that.

**Experience in Coding**

I started coding using Scratch, but I never got into it. I mostly did it at school. I started learning Python in like.. 3rd Grade? I did it for a while, but then I was introduced to C++. Currently, C++ is my main language when I write to you.

**Programming Languages**

I know Python, C++, HTML, and CSS.
