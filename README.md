# This is `conquerer-of-tourist.github.io`
## Hi there!
I'm Hengsheng Wang, a student at BASIS Independent Bellevue. I created this site back in the summer of 2024 with the intent of keeping it as permanent blog, but that obviously didn't work as I have a lot of other things to do in life. Recently, I've been starting to interact more with Github now that I can regularly get onto this platform (despite setbacks of 2FA).

## Experience & A Little About Me
I started out working with Python in about 4th grade. I took a couple of Grok Learning courses and contests, and looking back at those programs in Replit and my repositories definitely gives me a bit of nostalgia. In about 5th Grade, I started learning C++ and object-oriented programming via some course made by a British professor on Coursera.

One quote from a friend I will never forget: "I was thinking about math until I walked into a wall." (I will neither forget the friend nor the quote)

## Achievements
* AIME Qualifier
* USACO Silver Division (with 67 points on Jan Contest 1, 2026)

## Other Stuff
This section shouldn't be here. Oops. I am the (unofficial) lead developer for the BASIS Indepdendent Bellevue school newspaper (On a Monthly BASIS)'s website. Outside of programming, I also do math (AIME qualifier) and I swim competitively on PRO (PN), formerly on WEST (PN), CSC (PN), SMAC (PN), and EAST (PN). In 5th and 6th grade, I participated in the VEX IQ and V5RC robotics competitions.

I used to be really into art/drawing, planes, and I played the piano a lot up until 6th grade.
