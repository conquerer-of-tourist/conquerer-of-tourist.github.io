        <p>This is my <code>github.io</code> page. Welcome! Here I put things about me, and for the third time, I will attempt to make this a sustained log of USACO and other competitive programming problems I have solved.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student attending BASIS Independent Bellevue.</p>

        <p>You may know me by conquerer-of-tourist or hangboy on Discord, Codeforces, and Instagram. You might also recognize me by my go-to icon of the Inverse Ackermann function, which models the time complexity of the implementation of the Disjoint Set Union. The equation:</p>
        <p>\[\mathcal{O}(1) \approx \alpha^{-1}\]</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Recently, as of January 2026, I suggested to our school newspaper that they should have a website for people who want to revisit articles online. Since the middle of the month, I have been deploying and improving their site for On A Monthly BASIS via Github Pages. You can follow them on Github at bibvnewspaper. However, we are also considering the usage of template websites such as WIX and Base44, so you might see that dissapear sooner or later.</p>
