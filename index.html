        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student attending BASIS Independent Bellevue. Recently, (Feb 2026) I suggested to our school newspaper that they should have a website for people who want to revisit articles online. Since mid-January, I have been deploying and improving the site for <i>On A Monthly BASIS</i> via Github Pages. You can follow them on Github at <b>bibvnewspaper</b>. However, we are also considering the usage of template websites such as WIX and Base44, so you might see that dissapear sooner or later. ):</p>

        <p>You may know me by <code>conquerer-of-tourist</code> or <code>hangboy</code> on Discord, Codeforces, and Instagram. You can also recognize me by my go-to icon of the inverse ackermann function \(\alpha\)</p>
