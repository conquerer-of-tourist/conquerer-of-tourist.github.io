            <p>Yesterday I was doing other X-Camp Problems. It was fun.  In fact, Hoofball is a problem I am doing for a CPI (Competitive programming initiative) class, so I decided to post it here anyway and not do it later. I guess that wasn't really a "in fact". Anyway.</p>

That's the unit I'm doing right now at CPI. Tomorrow I have Pacific Northwest Swimming AG Championships. If I remember, I will post my results!</p>

            <p>Bruh.... PN Meet was fun and nice but anoying. Results are now here!:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>50M Breast: 38.23 Best Time | B Final Qual</li>
                <li>50M Fly: 32.18 Best Time | B Final Qual</li>
                <li>100M Breast: 1:26.?? Best Time | B Final Qual</li>
                <li>100M Fly: 1:13.?? Best Time | B Final Qual</li>
                <li>400M IM: 6:13:?? 1st Swim</li>
                <li>200M IM: 2:50:?? Best Time | B Final Qual</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The relays weren't fun because I had to deal with begin in the last heat. Like 3/4 times. I forgot to apply for Zones because I'm just built like that! Yeah! Overal, I improved a lot at this meet, but it was also really exhausting. I'm mostly annoyed because in several events I ranked like 9th or 10th or 11th, and I wasn't able to make A Finals. 35 Points for our team, most points scored from my team's Boys 11-12 year age group.</p>
            <p>I did so much swimming that I'm tired. Absolutely Crazy. I didn't even do a coding problem!!!!!</p>

            <p>At one point, when I get the time to, I will update the css and make this website more modern-looking and fancy. Considering things like Javascript to make blogging easier. Also, check out thecodingwizard.me to see my inspiration.</p>
            <h2>Saturday, July 27th, 2024. Blog Post #3</h2>
            <p>Even though the competition was just a <em>little</em> confusing. Being on team with Ethan, Bryant and Leon was definitely worth it. We scored 425 points (out of 1100). There were 11 Problems. We finished 3 and partially scored like another 3. I even got us 125 points! Yay!</p>

            <p>1. After champs, I've freed up a lot of time, so I got to meet some friends I haven't met in a while. I went to Microsoft's new Redmond campus today... it's so cool! Also, today = first day of August! Only like 3 more weeks till the start of school!</p>
            <p>2. Did I forget??? Griiinnd Grind.... Oh! I remember! I learned how to solve the 4x4 recently. Though I still can't remember the parity cases. And I take like 3.5 minutes. But that's still nice.</p>
            <p>3. USACO Solutions! Only 10 more days until the end of 100 Problems Bronze Contest! Time to start grinding! I've already done a problem, it is Why Did the Cow Cross the Road #2</p>

            <p>Good job, zone buddies! @Pacific Northwest Swimming. I haven't done blogging recently because of an excess of stuff. I know, I am very clear and not vague. Anyway, to recap what I've been doing: USACO Problems, Codeforces, and more coding. I'm working on a GPT 2 Level Model, but I decided to make a website before the actual thing lol. Font: Inter.</p>
