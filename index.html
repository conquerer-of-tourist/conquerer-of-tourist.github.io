        <h1>Hi! I'm Hengsheng.</h1>
        <p>This is my <code>github.io</code> page. Welcome! Here I put things about me, and for the third time, I will attempt to make this a sustained log of USACO and other competitive programming problems I have solved.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student attending BASIS Independent Bellevue. I currently swim on PRO Swimming (PN), and formerly SMAC, CSC, WEST, and EAST (PN).</p>

        <p>You may know me by conquerer-of-tourist or hangboy on Discord, Codeforces, and Instagram. You might also recognize me by my go-to icon of the Inverse Ackermann function, which models the time complexity of the implementation of the Disjoint Set Union. The equation:</p>
        <p>\[\mathcal{O}(1) \approx \alpha^{-1}\]</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Recently, as of January 2026, I suggested to our school newspaper that they should have a website for people who want to revisit articles online. For about half a month, I have been deploying and improving the website. However, drawbacks of the plan include the complexity of committing and adding new features and articles. So, we may switch to a template website in the future.</p>

        <p>For my own usage but also for the general good (and as to make a contribution to society), I have worked for a long time on an extensive set of solutions that I wrote as practice for the USACO as well as Codeforces round problems. With these solutions, I'm also in the process of tailoring well-written explanations that can carefully deliver the solution and thinking process.</p>

        <p>From 2024, I have written multiple Study Guides for general middles school topics, including Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry, History, and more. More information will be added later about this.</p>

        <p>For fun, whenever I get the time to, I am work on a project called "Radical Arguments." I will probably publish the full compilation of TeX PDFs at the end of 2026.</p>
