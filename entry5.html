    <h1>Entry 5 -> Happy New Year!</h1>
    <p>Its another year, yay! Fun facts about 2025:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> \( 45^2 = 2025 \) </p></li>
        <li><p> \( (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 9)^2 = 2025 \)</p></li>
        <li><p> \( 2025 = 40^2 + 20^2 + 5^2 \)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm in China, so I had some kind of advantage (I'll talk about it later). I completely forgot that it was the new year until about 10:00 the next morning in China, so I decided to celebrate the new year at 15:00 (my advantage) because that is the new year on the west coast in the US.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
    #include <>bits/stdc++.h<>
    using namespace std;

    vector<int> solve()
    {
        return {1, 2, 3};
    }

    int main()
    {
        int T;
        cin >> T;
        while (T--) {
            vector<int> ans = solve();
            answers.push_back(ans);
        }
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Woww... I actually got the multilined code to work. Now I have to style it. <strong>NOTE: AS OF THE TIME OF WRITING IT IS NOT SYNTAX-HIGHLIGHTED.</strong></p>

    <p>Well, now it is.</p>

    <p>I never actually kind of finished Blog Post 2, because I wasn't able to figure out how to incorporate multilined code into the website, but now I do, so I will convert my Google Doc pages into html once I can. It's going to be a lot of work...</p>
    <p>All of these solutions will also lead to a lot of files... at the moment, my directory looks like this:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-html">

    <p>Oh dear this is going to be a lot of files... :D</p>

    <p>I'm pretty sure that there is this thing called a "new year's resolution", right? Or goals for the new year? Anyway, here are a few of the things I want to accomplish in 2025:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Make AIME</p></li>
        <li><p>Pass USACO Silver</p></li>
        <li><p>Get super good at other stuff</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>One thing that I just noticed is that the include files (such as "iostream") won't show because of the arrow-pointer thingies, and HTML thinks that they are tags.. but they aren't, so it ends up looking a bit weird.</p>
