    <h1>Entry 3 -> Previous Blog Uploads </h1>
    <p>Before the construction of this new site, I had another website before this on the same domain, but I decided that it didn't look good and its organization was "not it". Because of this, I created this new site, but I decided not to replicate the original blog posts <i>exactly as they were</i>, so here you can find the original *important* posts:</p>
    <h2>July 27th, 2024</h2>
    <p>Long Course 2024 PNS Championships Results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>50 BR -> 38.23 -> B Final</li>
        <li>50 FL -> 32.18 -> B Final</li>
        <li>100 BR -> 1.26.== -> B Final</li>
        <li>100 FL -> 1.13.== -> B Final</li>
        <li>400 IM -> 6.13.== -> None</li>
        <li>200 IM -> 2.50.== -> B Final</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I scored 35 points in total, and unfortunately I forgot to apply for Zones (I'm just built like that, but also I don't have any AAA times anyway -> yet I still made Zones in 2022). The meet was exhausting overall. I didn't do a single coding problem!!!!</p>

    <h2>July 30th, 2024</h2>
    <p>I'm so cool I'm so cool I'm so cool im on a team with ethan chang im so cool im so cool</p>
    <p>At one point, when I get the time to, I will update the css and make this website more modern-looking and fancy. Considering things like Javascript to make blogging easier. Also, check out thecodingwizard.me to see my inspiration.</p>

    <p><strong>Sidenote: I actually did end up making a version on thecodingwizard.me but I kind of forgot about it, and then after looking at the websites of other USACO Guide creators, the format of the website looks like what it looks like now.</strong></p>

    <h2>After Teamscode</h2>
    <p>Even though the competition was just a little confusing. Being on team with Ethan, Bryant and Leon was definitely worth it. We scored 425 points (out of 1100). There were 11 Problems. We finished 3 and partially scored like another 3. I even got us 125 points! Yay! <b>Note: I forgot the date I wrote this.. I didn't record it.</b></p>

    <h2>August 1st, 2024</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of things to say. I hope I don't forget them!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>After champs, I've freed up a lot of time, so I got to meet some friends I haven't met in a while. I went to Microsoft's new Redmond campus today... it's so cool! Also, today = first day of August! Only like 3 more weeks till the start of school!</p></li>
        <li><p>Did I forget??? Griiinnd Grind.... Oh! I remember! I learned how to solve the 4x4 recently. Though I still can't remember the parity cases. And I take like 3.5 minutes. But that's still nice.</p></li>
        <li><p>USACO Solutions! Only 10 more days until the end of 100 Problems Bronze Contest! Time to start grinding! I've already done a problem, it is Why Did the Cow Cross the Road #2</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12/25/2024 (Edited)</h2>
    <p>A lot of stuff has happened since the last time I made a post (yaya) since life isn't supposed to be boring. I realized that this website's interface has some room for imporvement, but the styles will be something that I improve in the future.</p>

    <p>Recently, I started school, made friends, and BASIS wasn't was bad as I expected it would be (of course, the rigor of academics is expected). I still did a lot of thing every day and went to enough swim practices to satisfy my coach.</p>
    <p>I joined National Science Bowl club and BASIS Comp Coding Club ( \(BC^3\) ), let by mathandski, otherwise known as the famed Daniel. I finished 302A for X-Camp, and I finished HMA's tiring fall semester. I joined band. Yayy. I think I really learned how to manage my time during this first trimester at BASIS, and I had to go to student hours for the entire week before PNS Champs Short Course 2024 just for the Friday I would miss. (school)</p>
    <p>Also, I passed USACO Bronze, which is something I am really happy about because I had spent the whole summer $\text{grinding}$ coding problems. I also scored about 70 points at PNS Champs, which is my all time best (2nd best was 44 points or something from two years ago, and then 35 from last summer). I got one AAA time for the 50 Breastroke, and I also got at least five AAs, three of which are super close to AAAs. I qualified for four A finals and two B finals at champs. Tee Hee Hee!</p>
    <p>Now I'm on vacation in China and (you could say) I skipped Christmas Eve, since we left Vancouver, B.C. in the afternoon on the 24th and arrived in China at around the same time on the 25th. As of right now, I just left the Shanghai Hongqiao Train Station, and I'm sitting on some kind of high-speed train, going to Nantong. I'm going to spend the next 1.7 weeks in China, before returning to the U.S. on a Saturday to exterminate my jetlag.</p> 

    <p><b>Note: none of the other posts that I wrote would be considered "important" by me, so I didn't include them.</b></p>
