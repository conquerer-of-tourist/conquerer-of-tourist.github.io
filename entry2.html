    <h1>Blog Entry 2 -> Uploading Bronze Sols</h1>
    <p>These are the USACO Bronze Solutions for problems that I grinded over the summer last year. They helped me pass Bronze during the December contest that happened half a month ago.</p>
    <p>In the future, I might add another batch of solutions for the bronze problems that I AC'ed but did not write solutions for. As I am now in the silver level, I will be focusing on USACO Silver and possibly a little bit of Codeforces for now.</p>
